					<p>It's only my opinion but it's the one that is most important to me, and in my opinion Arsenal are the best football club in the world. What other club uses the word "the" in front of their name other than " The Arsenal".

When things are going wrong or there are problems the club rarely make them public, as they deal with them in a quiet and dignified manner. It's very rare to see Arsenal have any part in the underhand transfer dealings that other clubs get involved in because it just isn't the Arsenal way.

I'm not saying Arsenal are a shining beacon for all other clubs to aspire to, but they try their best to do their business in the best possible way.</p>
